## serializer-factory

This shows how to use the SerializerFactory implementation. An inbound message is read from a file the serialized to XML using the `hl7v2` data type with the strict parser option enabled. An outbound serializer is set up with the `delimited` data type with default options. A specified template is serialized to XML. A column of `tmp` is assigned a value from a field component of `msg`. Finally, the outbound serializer is used to convert `tmp` back to delimited text.
